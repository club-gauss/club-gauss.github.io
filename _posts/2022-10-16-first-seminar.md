# Our first seminar is reserved!
Hello!

I'm glad to announce to you that our first seminar is reserved.
Dr. Jonathan Frankle has accepted our proposal.
He will give us a talk about his famous work, [The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJl-b3RcF7),
and his recent work in [Mosaic ML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).
The planned format is a 45-minute talk + up to 45 minutes of Q&A and discussion over Zoom.
The zoom link will be updated on this post.
Also, we are planning to have an interview session with Dr. Jonathan Frankle.
The detailed information will be updated.
